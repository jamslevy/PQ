\\nProlog\\n (for \\\"Programming in Logic\\\") is a \\nprogramming language\\n based on a \\nsubset\\n of \\npredicate calculus\\n. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called \\nbackward chaining\\n.

This is because \\nProlog\\n does not know anything about \\nPlato\\n, and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called \\nclosed world assumption\\n). Finally ?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in \\\"Yes\\\" (and in some implemenations: \\\"Yes\\\": X=socrates)\\n\\nProlog\\n can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.

Recently automatic reasoners found in \\nsemantic web\\n a new field of application. Being based upon \\nfirst-order logic\\n, knowledge expressed using one variant of \\nOWL\\n can be logically processed, i.e., inference can be made upon it.

By contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly nonmonotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises. We know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible\\u2014that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of abduction, inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.

To take an example: suppose you live in a flat. Late at night, you are awakened by creaking sounds in the ceiling. You infer from these sounds that your neighbour upstairs is having another bout of insomnia and is pacing in his room, sleepless.
