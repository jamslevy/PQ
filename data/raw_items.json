The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the  capacity factor . Typical capacity factors are 20-40%, with values at the upper end of the range in particularly favourable sites.  [17]  [18]   For example, a 1 megawatt turbine with a capacity factor of 35% will not produce 8,760 megawatt-hours in a year, but only 0.35x24x365 = 3,066 MWh, averaging to 0.35 MW. Online data is available for some locations and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output.  [19]  [20]  ",

This could require large amounts of land to be used for wind turbines, particularly in areas of higher wind resources. Offshore resources experience mean wind speeds of ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources could contribute substantially more energy.

In binary plants, the hot water flows through heat exchangers, boiling an organic fluid that spins the turbine.

The Earth-Atmosphere system is in equilibrium such that heat radiation into space is equal to incoming  solar radiation , the resulting level of energy within the Earth-Atmosphere system can roughly be described as the Earth's \"climate.\" The hydrosphere (water) absorbs a major fraction of the incoming radiation. Most radiation is absorbed at low latitudes around the equator, but this energy is dissipated around the globe in the form of winds and ocean currents. Wave motion may play a role in the process of transferring mechanical energy between the atmosphere and the ocean through wind stress.  [14]   Solar energy is also responsible for the distribution of precipitation which is tapped by hydroelectric projects, and for the growth of plants used to create biofuels.",
